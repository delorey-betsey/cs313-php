                <p>There is something impressive about someone who can individual swim, bike and run fast, but that doesn't matter much with endurance triathlon training/racing. Sure, it can impact your fitness but you have to know how to put the pieces together and that is what triathlon training is all about. Creating new limits but knowing how to stay within them.</P>
                <p>Learn how to change your gears appropriately and how to adjust gears before stopping. This includes how to anticipate changing terrain and adjusting gears appropriately. Learn how to brake properly, especially before stopping or if slowing down in a group.</p>
                <p> Good Luck! and Have Fun!</p>
                <p>Length: Roughly 25 miles.</p>
