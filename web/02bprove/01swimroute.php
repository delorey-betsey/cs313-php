                <p>Swimming in the open-water (river, lake or ocean) can be very different from swimming in a local swimming pool. Besides the technical adjustments that you need to make to your stroke technique, the biggest factor for most people is adjusting to this strange environment and overcoming the fear and anxiety that it often represents. Get advice on converting your efficient pool stroke into an effective open-water stroke.</p>
                <p>Get used to wearing your wetsuit.  Practice controlled efficient relaxed breathing with each stroke.  Swim straight using a sighting technique of lifting your eyes out of the water to see where you are going.</P>
                <p> Good Luck! and Have Fun!</p>
