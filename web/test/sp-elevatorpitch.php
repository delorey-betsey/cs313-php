    <h1>ELEVATOR PITCH</h1>

    <p>I work with developers…owners, architects, general contractors, also sub-contractors, consultants, suppliers and so on…, from the beginning of a project, to help them create an effective, collaborative team.  Here’s my card (with bulleted list and contact name and info).</p>

    <ul>
        <li>We establish channels of communication and problem-solving protocols.</li>
        <li>We break down traditional barriers and teach collaborative principles.</li>
        <li>We build up a trust-based team.</li>
        <li>I consult on the governing documents, if necessary.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>You may be interested in a unique project I can show you here on the UW-Madison campus that was one of the first custom multi-party contracts, and we reached an award-winning outcome. In fact, we came in on time, under budget and with zero workplace injuries!
    </p>
    <p>Whatever challenges you face in your project management, I’d like to show you how Construction Collaboratory can make a big difference!  Have a good day--
    </p>
