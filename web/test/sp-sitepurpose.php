        <h1>SITE PURPOSE</h1>
<p>My website advertises my husband’s 30 years in his legal practice of sale and acquisition of real property, construction contracts and leasing.  He would like to offer his experience and consulting services on large construction projects to developers when he retires.  
He specializes in LEAN and Integrated Project Delivery construction contracts and methods.  These strategies in building project management focus on input from and cooperation among the main project partners from the outset of a project; the owner, the architect and general contractor. 
</p>
<p>Our target audience would be business and manufacturers, universities, and hospitals.  Anybody who has large project needs and is looking to think outside the box of traditional costly and inferior construction models.  
The Construction-Collaboratory website will be linked to cutting edge business and research facilities he has worked on.  Also, to biographical info at the website of the law firm he will have worked at for 30 years when he officially retires from the practice of law.
</p>
        <h1>Goals/Objectives</h1>
<p>The purposes of the website are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Gain exposure for the services he will offer—get his name out there.</li>
        <li>Sell the value of his services </li>
        <li>Disseminate his contact information</li>
        <li>Capture leads of people who land on our website for follow-up contacts.</li>
    </ul>

<p>The website compares and tries to sell the advantages of a project run with newer methodologies, like IPD and LEAN.  It will highlight the draw that these types of projects routinely come in ahead of schedule, under budget and with zero workplace injuries.  Everyone wins with all players on the same team from the get-go—the team approach!
</p>
<p>We offer obtaining large-law-firm-quality services from a seasoned and respected attorney.  In other words, obtaining quality at a substantially discounted rate.  Contruction-Collaboratory.com has an existing professional contact base and the ability to offer connections and referrals across partners, architects and contractors, to build the best teams for owners.
</p>
<p>We snag the contact with free initial consultations on new projects.
