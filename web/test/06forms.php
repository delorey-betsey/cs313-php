        <p>Kevin Delorey was appointed to Association of General Contractors of America (AGC) steering committee to review and revise their construction contract forms early in 2012.  The ConsensusDocs300 form, TriParty Agreement for Integrated Project Delivery, was the first standard IPD agreement published in the United States.   
        </p>
        <p>The Owner, Designer and Constructor all sign the same agreement. This agreement incorporates Lean principles and is also known as a relational contract. A core team at both the project management and project development levels is created to make consensus-based project decisions to increase project efficiency and results. 
        </p>
        <p>Kevin has been sought out to present seminars featuring full comparison of AGCâ€™s ConsensusDOCS and the American Institute of Architects (AIA) IPD Forms for Building Contractors in many settings to all different audiences.  Including:
